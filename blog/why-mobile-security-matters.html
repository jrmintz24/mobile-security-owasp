    <h1>Why Mobile Security Matters (Even to Sales Guys Like Me)</h1>

    <p>I’m not an engineer. I can’t reverse malware or dissect encryption protocols. I’m a sales guy. I talk to people, ask questions, tell stories — and sell things that make security teams' lives easier.</p>

    <p>So when I joined a mobile security company, I asked the obvious question: “Wait... people actually attack mobile apps?”</p>

    <p>The short answer? Yes. The long answer? You have no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes — and neither did I.</p>

    <p>Over the last few months, I’ve watched demos, talked to CISOs, and read more OWASP than I care to admit. I’ve learned that mobile apps are often the least protected part of a company’s digital presence — even though they hold customer data, control hardware, and connect to critical APIs.</p>

    <p>But here’s the thing that really stuck with me: attackers don’t care whether a target is 'mobile' or not. They care whether it’s vulnerable. And most apps are.</p>

    <p>Now I’m not going to pretend I’ve become a mobile security expert overnight. What I can do is bring a human lens to it. I can share the real conversations I’m having with prospects, the objections I hear, and how I explain MTD, app shielding, and jailbreak detection without sounding like a SOC analyst.</p>

    <p>And yes, I use AI to help me do it — including this post. That’s the point. This blog isn’t just about mobile threats. It’s about how someone like me — non-technical but curious — can learn to care, contribute, and educate others in the process.</p>

    <p>So if you're in sales, marketing, or just trying to talk tech without buzzword bingo, this blog’s for you. Let’s learn together. And let’s make mobile safe — for real humans.</p>
